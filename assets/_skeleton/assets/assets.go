// Package assets embeds the shipped default asset tree as the last-resort
// fallback the asset-resolution chain reaches for when neither a user
// override ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/toolname/) nor an installed share tree
// (<prefix>/share/toolname/assets/) has the requested file — e.g. a bare
// `go run` with nothing installed. Assets are inputs, never state (C5.3):
// this package only ever reads the tree baked in at build time.
