// Package registry holds the one table of harnesses that install,

// listings, unknown-harness errors, and the stale-artifact checks all read
// it, so those verbs can never disagree about what is installable or how
// to drive it. It is a leaf: it imports each harness subpackage for its
// Name constant and function set, and nothing imports it but the verbs and
// checks. internal/harness itself cannot hold this table because every
// subpackage imports it (a cycle), and neither verb package should own a
// fact both read.
