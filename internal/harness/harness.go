// Package harness holds the pure filter that selects which verbs project
// into a harness (C3.2's mechanical enforcement point), plus the shared
// comparisons every per-harness generator's callers use. The manifest's
// own --json output is never filtered — this package is the only consumer
// of the filter, and each subpackage (e.g. claudecode) is the only
// consumer of that harness's rendered output.
